#  Gene Therapy Delivery Simulation V2

**A command-line simulation to model vector-based gene delivery across different organs and mutation types.**

This educational tool allows users to explore core tradeoffs between gene therapy vectors (like retroviruses, adenoviruses, and lipid nanoparticles), tissue targeting, and mutation strategies (Insert, Replace, Silence). Designed as an interactive console app, it demonstrates key considerations in delivery system design for therapeutic genome editing.

##  Key Features

-  **3 Vector Types**: Retrovirus, Adenovirus, Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP)
-  **8 Target Organs**: Including brain, liver, muscle, bone marrow, etc.
-  **Mutation Strategies**: Insert, Replace, or Silence a gene
-  **Built-in Suitability Checks**: Warns if a vector has poor affinity for the selected tissue
-  **Probabilistic Outcome**: Each delivery has a success probability based on vector type
